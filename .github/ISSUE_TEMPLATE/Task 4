Feature: Create new task

Scenario: User successfully creates a new task with all information
Given I am on the DailyTasker application homepage
When I enter "Selesaikan Laporan Proyek Akhir" in the task description field
And I select the due date for tomorrow
And I press the "Add Task" button
Then the task "Selesaikan Laporan Proyek Akhir" with tomorrow's due date will appear in my task list.

Scenario: User tries to create a new task without a description
Given I am on the DailyTasker application homepage
When I enter nothing in the task description field
And I press the "Add Task" button
Then I will see an error message "Task description cannot be empty"
And a new task will not be created.
